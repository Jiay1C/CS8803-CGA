# Implementation

## Overview
The `sdf2` function defines a customized Signed Distance Function (SDF) used in a ray marching algorithm to render a dynamic scene. It extends the basic SDF approach by incorporating smooth blending, recursive spatial partitioning, and animation through time-based transformations.

## Key Components

### 1. **Time-Based Transformation**
- The animation of the scene is controlled by a normalized time variable `t`, derived from `iTime`.
- The function `easeInOutElastic` is applied to create a smooth transition effect.

### 2. **Recursive Spatial Partitioning**
- A hierarchical structure is built using **multiple spheres**, positioned recursively based on a transformation pattern.
- The recursion level depends on the **time parameter**, modifying sphere placement dynamically.

### 3. **Geometric Transformations**
- Spheres are arranged in a fractal-like structure using **translation and scaling**.
- A **binary pattern** determines sphere placement along horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`) axes.

### 4. **Smooth Blending of Shapes**
- The `sdfSmoothUnion` function is employed to smoothly blend multiple spheres, avoiding sharp intersections.

## Execution Flow
1. **Initialize Constants**
    - Define center position, base sphere radius, and distance factor for transformations.

2. **Iterate Over Spheres**
    - Compute recursive transformations based on **bitwise** operations.
    - Interpolate between previous (`c0`) and next (`c1`) positions using `fract_t`.

3. **Compute SDF for Each Sphere**
    - Apply `sdfSphere` to determine the distance function for each sphere.
    - Combine all distances using `sdfSmoothUnion` for a seamless shape transition.

4. **Return Final Distance Field**
    - The function outputs the minimum SDF value, defining the implicit surface for ray marching.
